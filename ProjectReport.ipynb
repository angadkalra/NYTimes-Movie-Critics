    "* For each critic, their most recent picks were gathered from NYT API; for each pick, the box office total was requested from TMDB API. \n",
    "* To determine the accuracy of a critic, I counted how many critic picks had box office totals greater than $100 million and divided that number by the total number of picks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q2:  \n",
    "* For each critic, sentiment analysis was performed on their recent movie reviews (scraped from NYT website) resulting in a value between -1 and 1 (sentiment polarity).  \n",
    "* Each review was plotted on a 2 dimensional plot with their x-coordinate being sentiment polarity and y-coordinate being 1 or 0, depending on if the movie was a critic's pick or not. \n",
    "* (still need to determine relationship...)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q3:  \n",
    "* Using the TMDB API, I retrieved all movies released between January 2010 and January 2017 and sorted them by descending revenue.  \n",
    "* Movies ranked 1st - 100th were put into one dataset, and movies ranked 200th - 300th were put into another dataset.\n",
    "* Movie characteristics compared were budget, genres, and release season.  \n",
    "* To compare budget, a side-by-side boxplot was used.  \n",
    "* To compare release season, mode was used.  \n",
    "* To compare genres, I will count the frequency of each genre in each dataset and rank them in descending order.  "
